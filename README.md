<b>"Please Audience, Focus on me, not on my Background Stuff!"</b>
Usually New Creators Don't have a Proper background to show, but the still record the video, as a result, the audience is mostly distracted and also Makes Fun of the background.Maybe the Creator have forgot to trim the video at certain points (where he/she is wearing shorts or something like that but unusual) and as a result, there is heavy criticism among the audience for that!

This Project is based on the fact that, Cheap Recording Cameras or Propietary Mobile Camera Software Don't Include it In-Built, thus the creator needs to spend some time in post pproduction (which is often annoying).

This Project is in Alpha (Infant Stage), but has a capability to provide a Pretty Good Result to your Videos.It takes a Video as a example and Blurs Everything that is not a "Human face".
